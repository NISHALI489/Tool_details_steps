/******************************************  Vector cast  ***********************************************/

Before explaning about the V-cast tool,
let's understand about the basics about testing how it works

There are two types of testing:
a. White box testing
b. Black box testing

a. White box testing: White box testing will be performed by developer, who is having coding knowledge. In this testing developer will check the
   internal behaviour.

b. Black box testing: The Tester will perform the Black box testing, here Tester will check for the only input and output.  

Unit test: It is the process of or test the quality of the code line by line, also check control flow, fills the gap between code flow control.

Static: After full code executation it will errors.
Dynamic: While code running at what line compiler will get error, it stop there running.

Step 1: Open V-cast tool.
		however you open the v-cast tool one pop window will be open.

Step 2: There we have to create environment
		in Environment we have to add some attributes for our Unit test.
